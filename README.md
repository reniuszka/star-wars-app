Description:

The app build with React18 and TS, using React Router and https://swapi.dev/documentation
I have expirenced that API responds a bit slow, so please be patient :)
There are nested calls to get all data for the design

My STEPS (libraries used):

1. npm create vite@latest (React and Typescript)
2. npm install normalize.css (CSS reset)
3. npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by (react router)

Your steps if you would like to download my code:

1. Node version ( node --version => v16+). Vite requires Node.js version 16+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
2. Download the files and follow the steps:
   - cd star-wars (or the name of the folder where the files are saved)
   - npm install (to install node modules)
   - npm run dev (to run the project)
   - open it in the browser (example: http://127.0.0.1:5173/)
